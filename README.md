<h1>What is?</h1>
Biblio-Sym is a <strong>library application</strong> which allows the user to take books for loan and also gives the administrator a full control of the books stock.

<h1>Why did I built this?</h1>
I decided to build this application because I like so much to read, and I saw this idea as an opportunity to explore a hobby that I have.

This will be updated as the application evolves.
