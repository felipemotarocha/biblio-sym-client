<h2>What is?</h2>
<p>BiblioSym is a <strong>library application</strong> which allows the user to take books for loan and also gives the administrator a full control of the books stock.</p>

<h2>Why did I build this?</h2>
<p>I decided to build this application because I really like to read books, and I saw the idea of creating a library system as an opportunity to explore a hobby that I have, at the same time that I improve my React knowledge.</p>

<h2>Server Side</h2>
<p>The server side of BiblioSym application is in another repository. It's build with Node.js, Express and MongoDB: https://github.com/fmroocha/biblio-sym-server</p>
